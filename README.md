# Blood Donation Platform  A C# console app connecting blood donors with people in need.  Donors register with location and blood type, consumers post urgent requests,  and the system matches them intelligently.  Great for learning OOP: inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, method overloading, and static classes.
